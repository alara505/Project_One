# Project_One

# Description
  This Project One is about Reimbursement Management, the Employee's create an reimbursement, while the Manager reviews the reimbursement, while deciding to approve or deny their request
  
# Technologies Used
- Flask
- Postman
- Python
- DBeaver
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Behave
- Selenium
- AWS RDS
- Psycopg

##Features
- Submitting reimbursement for a request
- Showing the entire table of a list for the manager based on their id which will require approval for the reimbursement
- Logging in using their credentials and to transition to their employee id, so it goes to the correct login page for the employee, along with the manager as well

## To Do List
- To add approve and deny buttons next to each of the requests to make more neat rather than inputing the information constantly
- Adding additional alerts to display to the user that they require this, rather than being pop-up windows to show
- Add buttons to the title so they're popping down as a list, rather then it being just word cluster all together

#Setup
- download gitbash
- create a repo folder to store the project and have easy access
  - Create a new folder and call it whichever name you would like to name it, and make sure to go github and copy the repo url
  - Then right click on the folder you created, make sure you open gitbash, then do the command -git clone (then paste the clone url here), press enter
  - Now you have access to the main branch and can start your project
- downloading the newest version of IDE for the project, or anything that suits your interest/preference
- Installing some plug-ins within the environment system, which for us we downloaded Flask, Pytest, Behave, Psychopg, along including/installing Selenium and Behave
- Download Visual Studio Code and copy the path of login.html
- Copy and paste the copy path into the url of the browser and make sure to look at the database for the correct credentials to login, rather be employee or manager.
- Employee and Manager share same login page, but different credentials, so repeat the two steps to access manager page.
